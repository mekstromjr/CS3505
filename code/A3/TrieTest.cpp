/*It should take in two command-line arguments, 
    each one a filename. 
    The first is a file of words, each on their own line, 
    with the words all lowercase and only made up of characters a-z. 
    The second is a file of queries, with each word or partial word on its own line. 
    You can use example code from that source to help you read a file.
    You should do error checking on the number of arguments and whether 
        or not the file exists and quit gracefully if anything is wrong.
    All the words in the first file should be added to a Trie.
    All the text in the second file should be tested against the Trie using the isAWord method. 
    The result of the test should be reported to standard out (cout) in the following fashion.
        Output "Testing text:", where text is the actual tested text from that line of the file.
        Output "Found" or "Not found" on the next line depending if the text is a word in the Trie or not.
        Output a list of words in the Trie that start with text as a prefix, with a space between each word and ending with a new line.*/

target: dependency
    command


Make Variables
    $(name) - variable to be placed into a command. Variables are all strings (no "" or '' needed)
        placed in the variables location. Can be used in the target line or the command line
        at top of file
            name = some_string 
    $@ - Variable for a command that copies the target name, in the below example $@ will be replaced with 'target'
    eg.
        /*Target Line */    target: target.o targetDependent1.o targetDependent2.h
    	/*Command Line*/        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ main.o Car.o

Multiple targets in same target line - executes the command once for each target
    eg. 
        target1 target2: dependency
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@

Clean Target
    Useful tool for creating a "clean build"
    -f flag means "force" ie. don't warn me about deleting and, if there's nothing to delete, don't tell me.
    - *.o means all files with anything ended with .o
    - rm main line is optional, but useful if your executable is called main

clean:
    rm -f *.o
	rm -f main
